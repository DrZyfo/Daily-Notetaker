# Daily-Notetaker
A shortcut on your desktop that creates notes based on the date, saves them. Kind of a dairy

I've made this minor application a while back ago when I was still experimenting with Python. However this application has been somewhat usefull for my daily personal use. I'd like to make this a bit more cutting-edge and sophisticated so it's easy to use for other people as well. At the moment you can input text in the terminal and it saves it in an ugly txt-file. I hope to make the UI a bit more appealing and easy to use. It would also be awesome if it could get stored in a virtual cloud, whereas you can use your phone too to add notes. The main objective is to use this as a easy, simple but effective personal dairy. - A private blog -
